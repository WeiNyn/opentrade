//!
//! This is the main entry point for the opentrade-pipeline application.
//! The pipeline provides data ingestion and processing capabilities for
//! cryptocurrency trading data from various exchanges.
//!
//! This binary serves as a placeholder for the main pipeline orchestration.
//! For specific functionality, use the dedicated binaries:
//! - `backfill_klines`: For historical kline data backfilling
//! - `streaming_klines`: For real-time kline data streaming

/// Main entry point for the opentrade-pipeline application.
///
/// This is currently a placeholder function that demonstrates the basic
/// structure of the pipeline application. In a production setup, this
/// could orchestrate various pipeline components or serve as a CLI
/// entry point for managing different pipeline operations.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```bash
/// # Run the main pipeline application
/// cargo run --bin opentrade-pipeline
/// ```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
